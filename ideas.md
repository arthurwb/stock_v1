# Stock suspension if it hits 0
If a stock ever reaches 0 the entire company/option is suspended for an amount of time while it is being bought out. All users lose any stocks they had in that company. 

Companies which are linked to that stock (not seen by the user) also take a hit which could result in a chain reaction.

# Bear and bull markets
Possible event where most (not all) markets either begin to rise (bull) or fall (bear).

Options that are below a certain threshold will need to become excempt from the event in order to prevent mass stock suspensions and a total collapse of the market. Though that would be pretty funny.
